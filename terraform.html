    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Q1:</strong> What is Terraform, and how does it work?</p>
        <p><strong>A1:</strong> Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. It manages resources across multiple cloud platforms.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q2:</strong> What is a Terraform provider?</p>
        <p><strong>A2:</strong> A Terraform provider is a plugin that allows Terraform to manage resources on a specific platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q3:</strong> How do you handle state management in Terraform?</p>
        <p><strong>A3:</strong> Terraform stores the state of your infrastructure in a state file, which helps track resource changes. You can use remote state backends like S3 for better collaboration and security.</p>
