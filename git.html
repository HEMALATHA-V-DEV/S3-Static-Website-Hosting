        <h1>Explanation of Key Git Concepts</h1>
    
        <div class="content">
            <h2>1. Git Hooks</h2>
            <p>Git Hooks are scripts that Git automatically executes before or after certain events such as commits and pushes. They allow for automation of tasks and enforce certain checks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-commit:</strong> This hook runs before a commit is made. It is commonly used to perform checks on the code, such as running linters or tests, to ensure code quality before committing changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-commit:</strong> This hook runs after a commit is made. It can be used for actions such as sending notifications or updating external systems with commit information.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-push:</strong> This hook runs before changes are pushed to a remote repository. It is useful for performing additional checks, like ensuring that tests pass before allowing the push.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-receive:</strong> This hook runs before changes are accepted into a remote repository. It can be used to enforce policies or perform checks on the incoming changes to ensure they meet certain criteria.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>2. Git LFS (Large File Storage)</h2>
            <p>Git LFS is an extension for managing large files within Git repositories. It replaces large files in the repository with text pointers, while storing the actual file content on a remote server.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To handle large files like multimedia files or datasets without bloating the repository size, which helps in faster cloning and more efficient storage management.</li>
                <li><strong>How it works:</strong> When a file is added to the repository that is tracked by Git LFS, Git stores a small pointer file in the repository while uploading the large file to a separate storage server.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Install Git LFS, track files with <code>git lfs track [file]</code>, and push changes using <code>git lfs push</code>.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>3. Git Attributes</h2>
            <p>Git Attributes allows you to define how Git manages certain files in the repository, including handling file merges and line endings.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>End-of-Line Characters:</strong> Configure Git to automatically convert line endings (e.g., CRLF to LF) to ensure consistency across different operating systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Merge Strategies:</strong> Specify how Git should handle merge conflicts for certain file types by defining custom merge drivers in the <code>.gitattributes</code> file.</li>
                <li><strong>How to use:</strong> Create a <code>.gitattributes</code> file in the repository root and define attributes for specific files or directories.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>4. Git Config</h2>
            <p>Git Config is used to configure user details, default behaviors, and settings for Git operations at various levels: local, global, and system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Configuration:</strong> Settings specific to a single repository (e.g., user name, email). Configured with <code>git config --local</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Configuration:</strong> Settings applicable to all repositories for the current user (e.g., default text editor). Configured with <code>git config --global</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>System Configuration:</strong> Settings applicable to all users on the system (e.g., core settings). Configured with <code>git config --system</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Common Settings:</strong> User name, email, merge tool configuration, and alias definitions can be configured using <code>git config</code> commands.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>5. Branching Strategies</h2>
            <p>Branching strategies define how branches are created, used, and managed throughout the development process to maintain code quality and streamline workflows.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Git Flow:</strong> A branching model with specific roles for branches:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Feature Branches:</strong> For developing new features.</li>
                        <li><strong>Release Branches:</strong> For preparing releases.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hotfix Branches:</strong> For quick fixes in production.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>GitHub Flow:</strong> A simpler workflow focusing on:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Short-lived Feature Branches:</strong> Create a branch for each feature and merge into the main branch.</li>
                        <li><strong>Frequent Deployments:</strong> Deploy regularly and ensure continuous delivery.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Trunk-Based Development:</strong> Teams work in short-lived branches that are merged directly into the trunk (main branch), promoting frequent integration and minimal branching.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>6. GitLab CI/CD</h2>
            <p>GitLab CI/CD integrates continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines directly within GitLab, enabling automated testing, building, and deployment of applications.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CI/CD Pipelines:</strong> Define automated workflows using the <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file. Pipelines consist of jobs and stages for building, testing, and deploying code.</li>
                <li><strong>Auto DevOps:</strong> Provides pre-configured pipelines for common workflows, including building, testing, and deploying applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Reporting:</strong> GitLab provides tools for monitoring pipeline status, test results, and deployment logs.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>7. GitOps Tools</h2>
            <p>GitOps is a methodology for managing Kubernetes clusters and deployments using Git as the source of truth for declarative infrastructure and application management.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ArgoCD:</strong> A Kubernetes-native continuous delivery tool that synchronizes the state of a Kubernetes cluster with a Git repository. It provides features for managing and visualizing application deployments.</li>

        <h1>Git Interview Questions and Answers</h1>

        <div class="qa">
            <div class="question">1. What is Git?</div>
            <div class="answer">Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by managing changes to files and tracking their history.</div>
    
            <div class="question">2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?</div>
            <div class="answer">Git is a version control system that tracks changes to files in a repository. GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and provides additional features such as issue tracking, code reviews, and collaboration tools.</div>
    
            <div class="question">3. How do you initialize a Git repository?</div>
            <div class="answer">To initialize a Git repository, use the command <code>git init</code> in the directory where you want to create the repository. This creates a new .git subdirectory that contains all the metadata for the repository.</div>
    
            <div class="question">4. What is a commit in Git?</div>
            <div class="answer">A commit is a snapshot of the changes made to the files in a Git repository. It represents a point in the repository's history and includes a unique identifier, a commit message, and metadata such as the author and timestamp.</div>
    
            <div class="question">5. How can you view the commit history?</div>
            <div class="answer">To view the commit history, use the command <code>git log</code>. This command shows a list of commits along with their commit messages, author information, and timestamps.</div>
    
            <div class="question">6. What is a branch in Git?</div>
            <div class="answer">A branch in Git is a separate line of development within a repository. Branches allow you to work on different features or bug fixes in isolation without affecting the main codebase. The default branch in Git is called <code>main</code> or <code>master</code>.</div>
    
            <div class="question">7. How do you create a new branch?</div>
            <div class="answer">To create a new branch, use the command <code>git branch [branch-name]</code>. This creates a new branch but does not switch to it. To create and switch to a new branch in one command, use <code>git checkout -b [branch-name]</code>.</div>
    
            <div class="question">8. What is a merge in Git?</div>
            <div class="answer">A merge is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. This is done using the <code>git merge</code> command, which combines the commits from the source branch into the target branch.</div>
    
            <div class="question">9. What is a pull request (PR)?</div>
            <div class="answer">A pull request (PR) is a feature provided by platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket that allows developers to propose changes to a repository. Other team members can review the changes, provide feedback, and approve or request modifications before merging them into the main branch.</div>
    
            <div class="question">10. How do you resolve merge conflicts?</div>
            <div class="answer">To resolve merge conflicts, you need to manually edit the conflicting files to incorporate the changes from both branches. After resolving conflicts, mark the files as resolved using <code>git add [file]</code>, and then commit the changes using <code>git commit</code>.</div>
    
            <!-- Continue with additional questions and answers in a similar format -->
    
            <!-- For demonstration, here are a few more questions to show the structure -->
    
            <div class="question">11. How can you discard local changes to a file?</div>
            <div class="answer">To discard local changes to a file and revert it to the last committed state, use the command <code>git checkout -- [file]</code>.</div>
    
            <div class="question">12. What does the <code>git status</code> command do?</div>
            <div class="answer">The <code>git status</code> command shows the state of the working directory and staging area. It displays which files are modified, staged for commit, or untracked.</div>
    
            <div class="question">13. How do you stage changes in Git?</div>
            <div class="answer">To stage changes, use the command <code>git add [file]</code>. This adds the specified file to the staging area, preparing it to be committed. You can also stage all changes with <code>git add .</code>.</div>
    
            <div class="question">14. What is the difference between <code>git pull</code> and <code>git fetch</code>?</div>
            <div class="answer"><code>git fetch</code> retrieves new commits from a remote repository but does not merge them into your local branch. <code>git pull</code> performs a <code>git fetch</code> followed by a <code>git merge</code> to update the local branch with the latest changes from the remote repository.</div>
    
            <div class="question">15. How do you view the differences between two commits?</div>
            <div class="answer">To view the differences between two commits, use the command <code>git diff [commit1] [commit2]</code>. This shows the changes made between the specified commits.</div>
