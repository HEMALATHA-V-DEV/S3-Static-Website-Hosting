    <h1>Comprehensive Overview of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured approach used for developing software systems. It encompasses several phases, each with specific objectives and deliverables. The SDLC ensures that the software meets quality standards and fulfills the requirements of stakeholders. Below is a detailed explanation of each phase and key concepts:</p>
        
        <h2>1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis</h2>
        <p>This initial phase focuses on understanding what the stakeholders need from the software. Key activities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gathering Requirements:</strong> Engaging with stakeholders to collect detailed information about their needs. This can involve interviews, surveys, workshops, and reviewing existing documentation.</li>
            <li><strong>Analyzing Requirements:</strong> Evaluating the gathered requirements to identify any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or feasibility issues. This step helps to refine the requirements and ensure they are clear and actionable.</li>
            <li><strong>Documenting Requirements:</strong> Creating a formal requirements specification document that outlines both functional and non-functional requirements. This document serves as a reference throughout the development process.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. System Design</h2>
        <p>In the design phase, the focus shifts to defining how the system will be built. Key activities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High-Level Design:</strong> Developing an architectural design that includes the overall structure of the system, including system components, modules, and their interactions. This provides a blueprint for the development process.</li>
            <li><strong>Low-Level Design:</strong> Creating detailed designs for each component, including data structures, algorithms, and detailed interaction diagrams. This phase translates high-level designs into actionable development tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Design Review:</strong> Conducting reviews of the design documents to ensure they meet the requirements and are feasible to implement. This step helps to identify potential issues before development begins.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Implementation (Coding)</h2>
        <p>During the implementation phase, the design is converted into executable code. Key activities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Code Development:</strong> Writing the actual code based on the design specifications. This involves programming the software components and integrating them into a cohesive system.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Review:</strong> Reviewing the code to ensure it meets quality standards, adheres to coding guidelines, and is free of defects. Code reviews help to identify and fix issues early in the development process.</li>
            <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Using version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage code versions and track changes. This helps in maintaining code integrity and facilitating collaboration among developers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Testing</h2>
        <p>The testing phase focuses on identifying and fixing defects before the software is deployed. Key activities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unit Testing:</strong> Testing individual components or units of code to ensure they function correctly. Unit tests verify that each unit of code performs as expected.</li>

        <p><strong>A80:</strong> Conflicts are managed through clear communication, negotiation, focusing on common goals, and involving stakeholders early in the decision-making process.</p>

        <p><strong>Q81:</strong> What is a Technical Debt, and how do you handle it?</p>
        <p><strong>A81:</strong> Technical Debt refers to the shortcuts or compromises made during development that may need to be addressed later. It is managed by prioritizing refactoring and code improvements.</p>

        <p><strong>Q82:</strong> What is the difference between Acceptance Testing and System Testing?</p>
        <p><strong>A82:</strong> Acceptance Testing is performed to ensure the software meets user requirements, while System Testing verifies the complete system’s functionality against specifications.</p>

        <p><strong>Q83:</strong> How do you handle rapidly changing requirements in SDLC?</p>
        <p><strong>A83:</strong> Changing requirements are managed through Agile methodologies, regular communication with stakeholders, and flexible planning that allows for iterative development.</p>

        <p><strong>Q84:</strong> What is the role of a Configuration Manager in SDLC?</p>
        <p><strong>A84:</strong> A Configuration Manager is responsible for maintaining consistency in the system’s performance and functionality by managing configuration items and documentation.</p>

        <p><strong>Q85:</strong> What is the importance of Code Reviews in SDLC?</p>
        <p><strong>A85:</strong> Code Reviews help identify defects early, improve code quality, ensure adherence to standards, and foster knowledge sharing among team members.</p>

        <p><strong>Q86:</strong> What is a Fishbone Diagram, and how is it used in SDLC?</p>
        <p><strong>A86:</strong> A Fishbone Diagram, also known as a Cause-and-Effect Diagram, is used to identify the root causes of a problem in software development.</p>

        <p><strong>Q87:</strong> How do you prioritize features in SDLC?</p>
        <p><strong>A87:</strong> Features are prioritized based on business value, user needs, technical dependencies, and resource availability.</p>

        <p><strong>Q88:</strong> What is a Retrospective, and why is it important in Agile SDLC?</p>
        <p><strong>A88:</strong> A Retrospective is a meeting where the team reflects on their work and processes to identify improvements for future Sprints.</p>

        <p><strong>Q89:</strong> What is Exploratory Testing in SDLC?</p>
        <p><strong>A89:</strong> Exploratory Testing is an approach where testers actively explore the system to identify defects without predefined test cases, relying on their experience and intuition.</p>

        <p><strong>Q90:</strong> How do you ensure that a system is scalable in SDLC?</p>
        <p><strong>A90:</strong> Scalability is ensured through careful design, load testing, optimizing code and infrastructure, and using scalable architecture patterns like microservices.</p>
